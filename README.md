# Contoso-Global-Sales-Profitability-Analysis-Power-BI-
Interactive Power BI dashboard for retail performance analysis. The project visualizes profitability, sales quantity, and return trends across products and global regions, enabling data-driven decisions for inventory and marketing.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced business intelligence (BI) visualization using Power BI, based on a large dataset of Contoso's global retail transactions. The goal was to transform raw sales and return data into a single, interactive, and high-impact dashboard to guide executive-level decisions regarding resource allocation, pricing, and inventory risk.
The dashboard allows users to immediately slice and analyze performance across three critical dimensions: Product, Geography, and Customer Class.


## Objectives

- Deconstruct Profitability: Clearly show the absolute and proportional distribution of Total Profit across various geographical regions (Continents).
- Analyze Sales Velocity: Track annual Sales Amount trends over multiple years to identify periods of growth or decline (2006-2014).
- Assess Customer Value: Visualize the revenue contribution of different customer tiers (Regular, Deluxe, Economy) to inform targeted marketing efforts.
- Identify Inventory Risk: Monitor the Return Amount metric to pinpoint product categories or manufacturers associated with high rates of returns.
- Enable Granular Filtering: Implement slicers for Manufacturer, Product Category, and Region/Country Name for dynamic, drill-down analysis.

## Tools & Technical Skills
- **Microsoft Power BI**
- Data Modeling: Designed and implemented a robust Star Schema to manage relationships between multiple fact and dimension tables efficiently.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized complex DAX measures to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Total Profit, Sales Quantity, and Return Amount.
- Power Query (M Language): Employed for resilient data cleaning, type conversion, and transformation processes.

## Key Insights 

- Europe is the Profit Engine: The continent of Europe drives over 59% of the total profit, indicating highly optimized regional strategies.
- Customer Value Hierarchy: The Regular customer class is the most valuable, generating significantly more revenue than the Deluxe and Economy tiers combined.
- High Return Leakage: The dashboard clearly highlights a substantial $97M Return Amount, necessitating immediate quality and inventory checks on high-risk product categories.
- Sales Volatility: Annual sales show high instability, with sharp dips (e.g., 2008-2010), requiring a deeper dive into market or operational causes during those specific years.
